hooks
new feature in version 16.7.0 which contradicts the difference mentioned
class components had the privilige of using states and functional components were stateless
however
hooks-lets you use state and other react features without writing a class
states and lifecycle hooks which were exclusive to class components can now be used in functional components as well

-no breaking changes:they will not break any code in your app even with the stable release
-completely opt in and 100 percent backwards compatible: if you don't want to no need to use hooks in your application
