Functional Components
functional components are basically javascript functions, 
they can optionally recieve an object of properties(props) and returns html(jsx) which describes the ui
use functional components as much as possible, if there is an option to create both class and functional components, always go for the functional components
Advantages of using this over class components
- absence of this keyword
- Solution without using state: if you have a number of components each with their own private states,
  maintainance and debugging your application becomes difficult, functional components tend to be without any complicated loguc and are mainly responsible for the ui
- this is why they are also called stateless/dumb/presentational components


Class Components
they are more feature rich
they can maintain their own private data - also called as state
they can contain complex ui logic
they provide lifecycle hooks
stateful/smart/container components


in each component we simply return some html but that is not html
that is jsx
