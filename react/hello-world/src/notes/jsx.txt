jsx
javascript sml(jsx) - extension to the javascript language syntax
with the react library, its an extension to write xml like code for elements and components
just like xml, jsx have a tag name, attributes and children

why do we need jsx?
jsx is definitely not a necessity to write react applications,
you can definitely use react without jsx
but jsx makes your react code simpler and elegant
it provides a syntax which is familiar to many developers
jsx ultimately transpiles to pure javascript which is understood by the browsers

//we need to import the react library while using jsx
//jsx translates into react.createElement which in turn uses the react library
