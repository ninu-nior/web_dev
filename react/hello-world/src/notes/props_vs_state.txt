props vs state

props
props gets passed to the component like function parameters
because the parents usually passes down the props to the child component, 
props are immutable, they are owned by the parent
can be accessed by
props-functional components
this.props-class components
props are read-only


state
state is managed within the component like variables declared in the function body
state is managed within the component and hence the function has full control to change it
can be accessed by
useState Hook-functional components
this.state-class components
state is mutable


both props and state hold information that influence the ui
